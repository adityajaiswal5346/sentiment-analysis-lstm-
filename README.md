Movie review sentiment classification using LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow)

# üß† Text Classification using Deep Learning  

This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model for **text classification** using **TensorFlow/Keras** in **Google Colab**.  
The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset with proper preprocessing, tokenization, and training steps.
